# Hey there, I'm Moustafa Ahmed 👋

I'm a backend-focused software engineer who enjoys building practical, well-structured solutions — mostly using Laravel, PHP, and MySQL. My repositories are a mix of personal projects, experiments, and tools I've built either to solve real problems or to sharpen my skills.

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here
- **Clean and maintainable backend code**
- **RESTful APIs and integration examples**
- **Custom utilities and tools**
- **Learning-focused projects and technical deep-dives**

## 💻 Tech Stack
| Area | Technologies |
|------|--------------|

## 👨‍💻 About Me
I care about writing clear, scalable code and enjoy solving complex backend problems. While backend development is my comfort zone, I occasionally step into the frontend when the project calls for it. I'm always looking to learn new techniques and improve how I build things.
